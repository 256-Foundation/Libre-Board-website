## Scope:
One Project Manager position and one to two engineer positions to fulfill the mission of The 256 Foundation, “Dismantle the proprietary mining empire to make Bitcoin and freedom tech accessible to anyone”. This grant proposal aims to secure funding for:

* One project manager to oversee and ensure mission adherence, timeliness, and execution. 
* One to two engineers to develop the Libre Board hardware.
* Libre Board specifics: Fully open-source with a variety of I/O standards and versatile compute module configuration. 
* Supporting documentation and specifications. 
* This project is fully open-source CERN-OHL-S licensed.
* Excluded from this proposal are sales, distribution, marketing, and customer technical support.

In summary, the Libre Board project delivers an open-source mining control board with a variety of I/O standards including but not limited to 8 USB ports to communicate with up to 8 Ember One hashboards, Ethernet port, WiFi adapter, an HDMI port, fan connections, NVME SSD connection to expand the storage volume capacity, two 100-pin high density electrical interface connectors for the compute module, and accepts 12-24 VDC input voltage. The open-source nature makes integrating it in a variety of ways possible; giving end-users complete control over all variables of form factor and which I/O connections are required for their miners.

## Deliverables:
The deliverables from this grant are the successful execution of the project more so than tangible goods. Successful execution of this grant project means the delivery of a validated design for an open-source mining control board with several I/O standards and compatibility with various compute modules. The deliverables will be produced within the allotted timeline and for the available budget, resulting in an open-source project that aligns with The 256 Foundation mission and benefits the public at large. 

## Timeline:
The timeline for this grant proposal is twelve months with the opportunity to extend the grant at the conclusion of each twelve month period, pending negotiations.

## Materials:
Materials for this project’s prototype are included in the budget. Potential materials for the project may include but are not limited to miscellaneous components, various compute modules, custom designed PCBs, and various other tools or software.

## Team Members:
This proposal is for one project manager and one engineer. 

## Budget:
For security reasons, exact dollar amounts are kept confidential. This project budget covers fair-market compensation for one project manager as well as the materials, travel expenses, and living expenses for one engineer for twelve months. Funds are disbursed monthly in equal amounts. Within 30-days prior to the expiration of this grant, a renewal opportunity will open and be subject to review and negotiation.
