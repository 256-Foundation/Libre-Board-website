## Open Control

## Motivation
There are no open-source control boards and we set out to change that with this grant. There are many aftermarket control boards but they are all closed source. First and foremost the Libre Board will be built to finalize the Ember One complete mining system. There will be a number of options added to the first Libre Board with the intention of it being able to handle running a Bitcoin full node and stable Stratum server while also running the Ember One hashboards. There will be a wide selection of standardized I/O ports on the Libre Board like USB adapters for connecting to the Ember One hashboards, Ethernet, HDMI, NVME, fan connectors, and WiFi. Future forks of the Libre Board can then modify the form factor and modify the I/O options and change the fan and hashboard connectors to match Antminers, Whatsminers, or any other miner that the end user wants. The Libre Board will also feature standardized two 100-pin connectors for the compute module so that users can decide if they want to run a RISC-V, ARM, or other processor. Since the mining firmware, Mujina, is Linux based it can be deployed on any module the end user chooses.

## Scope:
One Project Manager position and one engineer position to fulfill the mission of The 256 Foundation, “Dismantle the proprietary mining empire to make Bitcoin and freedom tech accessible to anyone”. This grant has secured funding for:

* This grant officially launched on April 5, 2025.
* One project manager to oversee and ensure mission adherence, timeliness, and execution. 
* One engineer to develop the Libre Board hardware.
* Libre Board specifics: Fully open-source with a variety of I/O standards and versatile compute module configuration. 
* Supporting documentation and specifications. 
* This project is fully open-source CERN-OHL-S licensed.
* Excluded from this proposal are sales, distribution, marketing, and customer technical support.

## Deliverables:
The deliverables after six months will be a mining control board based on the Raspberry Pi Compute Module I/O Board with at least the following connections: 

* USB hub integration
* support for fan connections
* NVME expansion
* two 100-pin connectors for the compute module
* Ethernet port
* HDMI port
* an Rpi 40-pin header
* a MIPI port for touchscreen
* accepts 12-24 VDC input power voltage.

The initial release of Libre Board is being built built in such a way that it supports long-term goals like alternative compute modules such as ARM, x86, and RISC-V

## Timeline:
The timeline for this grant is six months with the opportunity to extend the grant at the conclusion of each six month cycle, pending negotiations.

## Materials:
Materials for this project’s prototype are included in the budget. Potential materials for the project may include but are not limited to miscellaneous components, various compute modules, custom designed PCBs, and various other tools or software.

## Team Members:
Lead Engineer = [@Schnitzel](https://x.com/Schnitzel)
Project Manager = [@econoalchemist](https://x.com/econoalchemist)

## Budget:
For security reasons, exact dollar amounts are kept confidential. This project budget covers fair-market compensation for one project manager as well as the materials, travel expenses, and living expenses for one engineer for six months. Funds are disbursed monthly in equal amounts. Within 30-days prior to the expiration of this grant cycle, a renewal opportunity will open and be subject to review and negotiation.
